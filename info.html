        <ul class="info-list">
            <li>Never hike alone. You need to have a partner in case you have an accident.</li>
            <li>Know how to get to your destination, which may mean buying a map and carrying a compass.</li>
            <li>Along the way, you may need to refill your water supply. Know where to find water, and have that marked on your map.</li>
            <li>Always look at the weather forecast ahead of time and wear layers that you can remove as you’re hiking.</li>
            <li>If you have a four-legged friend, check if dogs are allowed on the trail. Everywhere has different rules about being on/off leash.</li>
