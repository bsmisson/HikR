        <h1>Trail Conditions </h1>
        <h3>Using trails when they are muddy is the leading cause of trail damage.</h3>
        <p>Here are the Top 5 reasons that you should not use muddy trails:</p>
        <ul class="info-list">
            <li>When trails are muddy, users invariably travel along the adjacent vegetation to avoid the mud. This tramples and kills trail side vegetation and widens our trails - and thus we lose the single track character of our trail system.</li>
        <li>As trails widen, erosion increases and the trails become increasingly difficult to maintain sustainability. Trail crews cannot adequately repair this type of damage in the Foothills.</li>
        <li>Drainage structures put in by trail crews to divert water and curtail erosion are trampled and flattened - making them ineffective and again increasing erosion along our trail system. No one likes to travel along deeply eroded trails - so they travel to the side and create additional, parallel routes. This again leads to loss of vegetation and eventual increased erosion.</li>
        <li>Those deep foot prints, hoof prints, tire tracks and yes - even paw prints invariably freeze and become ankle twisting, teeth chattering experiences for those trail users trying to do the right thing - travel on trails when they are frozen (or dry).</li>
    <li>We are trying to maintain and manage the Ridge to Rivers trail system not only for ours, but for future generations. Continued irresponsible use of our trails will ensure one thing - that our children will not be able to enjoy the experiences that we currently have.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Please help up preserve the integrity of the trail system by doing the following:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Stay off of muddy trails. Pay attention - if you are leaving tracks, turn back.</li>
        <li>In winter, ride or hike early in the morning when trails are frozen hard.</li>
        <li>Check daily trail conditions on our website or on Facebook to know whether you should be on the trails during winter months.</li>
        <li>If you encounter short stretches of mud, ride or walk through them. Donâ€™t leave the trail as this kills trailside vegetation and leads to trail widening.</li>
    </ul>
