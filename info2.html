        Using trails when they are muddy is the leading cause of trail damage.
      </h3>
      <h4>Here are the Top 5 reasons that you should not use muddy trails:</h4>
      <ul class="info-list">
        <li>
          When trails are muddy, users invariably travel along the adjacent
          vegetation to avoid the mud. This tramples and kills trail side
          vegetation and widens our trails - and thus we lose the single track
          character of our trail system.
        </li>
        <li>
          As trails widen, erosion increases and the trails become increasingly
          difficult to maintain sustainability. Trail crews cannot adequately
          repair this type of damage in the Foothills.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drainage structures put in by trail crews to divert water and curtail
          erosion are trampled and flattened - making them ineffective and again
          increasing erosion along our trail system. No one likes to travel
          along deeply eroded trails - so they travel to the side and create
          additional, parallel routes. This again leads to loss of vegetation
          and eventual increased erosion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Those deep foot prints, hoof prints, tire tracks and yes - even paw
          prints invariably freeze and become ankle twisting, teeth chattering
          experiences for those trail users trying to do the right thing -
          travel on trails when they are frozen (or dry).
        </li>
        <li>
          We are trying to maintain and manage the Ridge to Rivers trail system
          not only for ours, but for future generations. Continued irresponsible
          use of our trails will ensure one thing - that our children will not
          be able to enjoy the experiences that we currently have.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="h4">
        Please help up preserve the integrity of the trail system by doing the
        following:
      </h4>
      <ul class="info-list">
        <li>
          Stay off of muddy trails. Pay attention - if you are leaving tracks,
          turn back.
        </li>
        <li>
          In winter, ride or hike early in the morning when trails are frozen
          hard.
        </li>
        <li>
          Check daily trail conditions on our website or on Facebook to know
          whether you should be on the trails during winter months.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you encounter short stretches of mud, ride or walk through them.
          Donâ€™t leave the trail as this kills trailside vegetation and leads to
          trail widening.
        </li>
      </ul>
